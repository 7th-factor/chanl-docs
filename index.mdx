# Welcome to Chanl

Chanl helps you build reliable AI voice agents by making it easy to test them before they talk to customers, monitor them while they work, and continuously improve their performance based on real data.

## Why Chanl?

Building AI voice agents is one thing. Knowing they actually work is another. Chanl solves the three biggest challenges you face:

  <Card title="Testing is Hard" icon="flask">
    How do you know your agent handles every customer type before going live?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitoring is Complex" icon="eye">
    Once live, how do you catch issues in real-time before they impact customers?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Improvement is Guesswork" icon="chart-line">
    Without data, how do you know what to fix and if changes actually help?
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Agent">
    Sync your VAPI, Bland, or custom agent to Chanl

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.chanl.ai/v1/agents/connect \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{"provider": "vapi", "agent_id": "your-agent-id"}'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Test Personas">
    Define the customer types your agent needs to handle

    Examples: frustrated customer, detail-oriented buyer, price-sensitive prospect
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Your First Scenario">
    Test your agent against multiple personas automatically

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.chanl.ai/v1/scenarios \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "name": "Refund Request Test",
        "personas": ["frustrated", "analytical"],
        "agents": ["your-agent-id"],
        "scorecard": "customer-service"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
