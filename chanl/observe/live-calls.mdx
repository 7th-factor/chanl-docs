# Live Call Monitoring

Live call monitoring lets you watch conversations as they happen, intervene when needed, and ensure your AI agents maintain quality standards with every customer interaction.

## Why Monitor Live Calls?

Real-time monitoring helps you:
- **Catch issues immediately** - Fix problems before they escalate
- **Provide instant support** - Help agents when they get stuck
- **Ensure compliance** - Verify agents follow required procedures
- **Learn quickly** - See how agents handle unexpected situations

<Info>
**Example**: You notice an agent struggling with a complex refund request. You can transfer the call to a human agent immediately, preventing customer frustration.
</Info>

## What You See

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Via API">
    ```bash
    # List all active calls
    curl https://api.chanl.ai/v1/live-calls \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

    Response:
    ```json
    {
      "activeCalls": [
        {
          "id": "call_abc123",
          "from": "+1234567890",
          "to": "+1987654321",
          "agent": "agent-v1",
          "duration": 142,
          "status": "in_progress",
          "currentScore": 87,
          "alerts": ["none"],
          "isSimulation": false
        }
      ],
      "totalActive": 1
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Live Call Sources

Calls come from two sources:

### Real Customer Calls

Production calls from actual customers:
- Connected via VAPI, Bland, or other providers
- Appear with `"isSimulation": false`
- Can have immediate business impact
- Require faster intervention

### Test Simulations

Automated test calls from scenarios:
- Appear with `"isSimulation": true`
- Running as part of scheduled testing
- Lower priority for monitoring
- Good for training and practice

## Available Actions

### Monitor & Observe

Watch without intervening:

```bash
# Get live transcription updates
curl https://api.chanl.ai/v1/live-calls/call_abc123/transcript \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "callId": "call_abc123",
  "transcript": [
    {
      "speaker": "agent",
      "timestamp": 0,
      "text": "Thank you for calling. How can I help?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "customer",
      "timestamp": 3.2,
      "text": "I need to return a product."
    }
  ],
  "lastUpdate": "2024-01-15T10:30:42Z"
}
```

### Transfer to Human

Hand off to a live agent when needed:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chanl.ai/v1/live-calls/call_abc123/transfer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transferTo": "human-agent-queue",
    "reason": "Complex issue requiring human judgment",
    "context": "Customer requesting exception to return policy"
  }'
```

**When to transfer**:
- Agent is clearly failing to resolve issue
- Customer is extremely frustrated
- Compliance or legal concerns arise
- Request falls outside agent's capabilities

### End Call

Terminate the call if necessary:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chanl.ai/v1/live-calls/call_abc123/end \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reason": "Abusive customer",
    "note": "Customer using inappropriate language"
  }'
```

<Warning>
Use this sparingly. Ending calls abruptly creates poor customer experience.
</Warning>

### Add Notes

Document observations during the call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chanl.ai/v1/live-calls/call_abc123/notes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "note": "Agent handled objection well, good empathy shown",
    "timestamp": 145,
    "category": "positive"
  }'
```

## Alert-Triggered Calls

Calls that trigger alerts need immediate attention:

### Alert Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quality Drop">
    Real-time score falls below threshold (e.g., below 70)

    **Action**: Review conversation and consider intervention
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compliance Issue">
    Agent misses required disclosure or violates policy

    **Action**: Intervene immediately if legally required
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customer Frustration">
    Sentiment analysis detects anger or dissatisfaction

    **Action**: Monitor closely, prepare to transfer
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent Stuck">
    Agent repeating same responses or making no progress

    **Action**: Transfer to human or provide guidance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Viewing Alert Calls

Filter to see only calls with active alerts:

```bash
curl https://api.chanl.ai/v1/live-calls?hasAlerts=true \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "activeCalls": [
    {
      "id": "call_xyz789",
      "from": "+1234567890",
      "agent": "agent-v1",
      "duration": 287,
      "currentScore": 68,
      "alerts": [
        {
          "type": "quality_drop",
          "severity": "high",
          "message": "Score dropped below 70",
          "triggeredAt": 245
        },
        {
          "type": "customer_frustration",
          "severity": "medium",
          "message": "Customer expressing dissatisfaction",
          "triggeredAt": 267
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Real-Time Streaming

Subscribe to live updates via WebSocket:

```javascript
const chanl = require('@chanl/sdk');

// Connect to live call stream
const stream = chanl.liveCalls.stream({
  agents: ['agent-v1', 'agent-v2'],
  includeTranscript: true,
  alertsOnly: false
});

stream.on('call_started', (call) => {
  console.log(`ðŸ“ž New call started: ${call.id}`);
  console.log(`Agent: ${call.agent}, From: ${call.from}`);
});

stream.on('call_updated', (update) => {
  console.log(`Call ${update.id} - Score: ${update.currentScore}`);
  if (update.transcript) {
    console.log(`Latest: ${update.transcript.text}`);
  }
});

stream.on('alert_triggered', (alert) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš¨ Alert on call ${alert.callId}: ${alert.message}`);

  // Auto-notify team
  if (alert.severity === 'high') {
    notifyTeam(alert);
  }
});

stream.on('call_ended', (call) => {
  console.log(`Call ended: ${call.id}, Final score: ${call.finalScore}`);
});
```

## Monitoring Multiple Agents

Track all agents from a single dashboard:

```javascript
const chanl = require('@chanl/sdk');

// Get overview of all active calls
const overview = await chanl.liveCalls.overview({
  groupBy: 'agent'
});

console.log(overview);
/*
{
  agents: [
    {
      id: "agent-v1",
      activeCalls: 3,
      avgScore: 88.2,
      activeAlerts: 1
    },
    {
      id: "agent-v2",
      activeCalls: 5,
      avgScore: 91.7,
      activeAlerts: 0
    }
  ],
  totalActiveCalls: 8,
  avgScoreAcrossAll: 90.3
}
*/
```

## Performance Tracking

Monitor how calls are progressing:

### Call Duration Tracking

```bash
curl https://api.chanl.ai/v1/live-calls/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "activeCalls": 12,
  "avgDuration": 4.2,
  "longestCall": {
    "id": "call_long123",
    "duration": 847,
    "agent": "agent-v1"
  },
  "callsWithAlerts": 3,
  "callsOverThreshold": 2
}
```

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Alerts First">
    Configure automated alerts so you only need to monitor flagged calls, not every single one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Intervention Rules">
    Create clear guidelines for when to transfer vs when to let the agent continue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document Interventions">
    Always add notes when you take action so you can analyze patterns later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use for Training">
    Watch live calls to understand how agents handle real situations and identify training needs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Peak Hours">
    Pay extra attention during high-volume periods when issues are more likely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not seeing any live calls">
    **Problem**: Live calls list is empty

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify agents are actually receiving calls
    - Check agent connection status
    - Confirm you have permission to view live calls
    - Try refreshing the page
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transcription lagging behind">
    **Problem**: Text updates delayed from actual conversation

    **Solutions**:
    - This is normal - expect 2-5 second delay
    - Check your internet connection
    - Try refreshing if delay exceeds 10 seconds
    - Contact support if issue persists
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't transfer call">
    **Problem**: Transfer action fails

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify human agent queue is available
    - Check if transfer is configured for this agent
    - Ensure call is still active
    - Try again or end call if critical
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Alerts not appearing">
    **Problem**: Expected alerts not showing on live calls

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify alert rules are configured and active
    - Check if alert thresholds are set correctly
    - Confirm agents are linked to alert rules
    - Review alert configuration in settings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
