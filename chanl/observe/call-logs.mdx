# Call Logs

Call logs give you access to every conversation your agents have hadâ€”whether from test simulations or real customer calls. Use them to analyze performance, identify training opportunities, and understand what's working (and what's not).

## Why Call Logs Matter

Historical call data helps you:
- **Identify patterns** - See recurring issues across many conversations
- **Validate improvements** - Compare performance before and after changes
- **Train better agents** - Use successful calls as training examples
- **Ensure compliance** - Audit conversations for regulatory requirements

<Info>
**Example**: Searching call logs reveals that 80% of escalations happen when customers mention "refund policy." You update the agent's prompt to address this proactively.
</Info>

## What's in a Call Log?

Each call log contains:

## Analyzing Call Logs

### Run Analysis on Historical Calls

Analyze calls that weren't evaluated when they occurred:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chanl.ai/v1/call-logs/call_abc123/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scorecard": "customer-service-quality"
  }'
```

This generates:
- Quality score based on scorecard criteria
- AI-powered analysis of strengths and weaknesses
- Specific recommendations for improvement
- Comparison to similar calls

### Batch Analysis

Analyze multiple calls at once:

```javascript
const chanl = require('@chanl/sdk');

// Analyze all unscored calls from last week
const results = await chanl.callLogs.batchAnalyze({
  filters: {
    dateRange: {
      start: '2024-01-08',
      end: '2024-01-15'
    },
    analyzed: false
  },
  scorecard: 'customer-service-quality'
});

console.log(`Analyzed ${results.count} calls`);
console.log(`Average score: ${results.avgScore}`);
```

## Search and Filtering

      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By Date Range">
    ```bash
    # Find calls from specific period
    curl "https://api.chanl.ai/v1/call-logs" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "dateRange": {
          "start": "2024-01-01",

## Finding Training Data

### High-Quality Call Examples

Find calls to use as training data:

```javascript
const chanl = require('@chanl/sdk');

// Find top-performing calls
const topCalls = await chanl.callLogs.list({
  minScore: 90,
  dateRange: '90d',
  limit: 50,
  sortBy: 'score',
  order: 'desc'
});

// Export for fine-tuning
const trainingData = await chanl.fineTuning.prepareDataset({
  calls: topCalls.map(c => c.id),
  format: 'conversational'
});

console.log(`Prepared ${topCalls.length} high-quality examples for training`);
```

### Problem Pattern Identification

Find calls with recurring issues:

```javascript
const chanl = require('@chanl/sdk');

// Find common failure patterns
const patterns = await chanl.callLogs.analyzePatterns({
  filters: {
    maxScore: 70,
    dateRange: '30d'
  },
  groupBy: 'issue_type'
});

console.log('Common issues:');
patterns.forEach(p => {
  console.log(`- ${p.issue}: ${p.count} occurrences (${p.percentage}%)`);
});

/*
Common issues:
- Refund policy confusion: 23 occurrences (34%)
- Unable to verify customer: 15 occurrences (22%)
- Tool failure: 12 occurrences (18%)
*/
```

## Compliance & Auditing

### Compliance Search

Find calls for regulatory review:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.chanl.ai/v1/call-logs/compliance-search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dateRange": {
      "start": "2024-01-01",
      "end": "2024-01-31"
    },
    "requiredDisclosures": [
      "data_privacy_notice",
      "call_recording_notice"
    ],
    "onlyFlagged": true
  }'
```

Returns calls missing required disclosures:
```json
{
  "flaggedCalls": [
    {
      "callId": "call_compliance123",
      "date": "2024-01-15T09:30:00Z",
      "missingDisclosures": ["call_recording_notice"],
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ],
  "totalFlagged": 3,
  "complianceRate": 98.7
}
```

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze Regularly">
    Run analysis on all calls, not just the ones with obvious issues. You'll discover patterns you didn't know existed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search Before Building">
    Before creating new scenarios, search call logs to find real examples of situations you want to test.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export for Records">
    Regularly export call data for compliance and backup purposes. Don't rely solely on cloud storage.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tag and Categorize">
    Add tags to calls (e.g., "excellent_example", "training_needed") for easier filtering later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare Time Periods">
    When you make changes, compare call logs from before and after to measure impact.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing calls in logs">
    **Problem**: Expected calls not appearing in call logs

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify date range filter includes when call occurred
    - Check if call actually completed (not dropped)
    - Confirm agent is connected and logging enabled
    - Look in failed calls section
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't play audio">
    **Problem**: Audio playback fails or URL expired

    **Solutions**:
    - Audio URLs expire after 1 hour - request new URL
    - Check browser allows audio playback
    - Try downloading file instead of streaming
    - Verify call has audio recording (some simulations might not)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Analysis takes too long">
    **Problem**: Batch analysis timing out or very slow

    **Solutions**:
    - Reduce batch size to 50-100 calls at a time
    - Run analysis during off-peak hours
    - Consider processing in smaller date ranges
    - Contact support for large-scale analysis needs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search not finding calls">
    **Problem**: Transcript search returns no results

    **Solutions**:
    - Try broader search terms (e.g., "refund" vs "refund policy")
    - Verify spelling of search terms
    - Check if calls have been transcribed
    - Expand date range
