# Automated Alerts

Alerts automatically notify you when something goes wrong with your AI agents—whether it's a quality issue, compliance violation, or technical problem. Instead of manually monitoring every call, let alerts catch issues for you.

## Why Alerts Matter

You can't watch every conversation. Alerts help you:
- **Catch problems immediately** - Get notified within seconds
- **Focus on what matters** - Only review flagged calls, not every single one
- **Prevent escalations** - Fix issues before customers get more frustrated
- **Ensure compliance** - Know immediately when regulations aren't followed

<Info>
**Example**: An alert notifies you that Agent V1 has missed the required call recording disclosure in 3 calls today. You fix the prompt immediately before more violations occur.
</Info>

## How Alerts Work

You define conditions to monitor (e.g., "score drops below 70"), and Chanl watches all calls for those conditions. When triggered, you're notified via your chosen channel.

```
Call happens → Monitored by alert rules → Condition met → Notification sent
```

## Notification Channels

### Email Notifications

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "email": {
      "recipients": [
        "team@company.com",
        "oncall@company.com"
      ],
      "subject": "Alert: {{alert_name}}",
      "includeCallLink": true,
      "includeTranscript": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Slack Integration

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "slack": {
      "webhook": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL",
      "channel": "#ai-agent-alerts",
      "mentionOnCritical": "@oncall",
      "includeActions": true
    }
  }
}
```

The Slack notification includes:
- Alert details
- Call information
- Quick action buttons (View Call, Transfer, Dismiss)
- Link to full analysis

### Webhook Integration

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "webhook": {
      "url": "https://your-system.com/chanl-alerts",
      "method": "POST",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN",
        "X-Source": "chanl"
      },
      "payload": {
        "alertId": "{{alert_id}}",
        "callId": "{{call_id}}",
        "severity": "{{severity}}",
        "timestamp": "{{timestamp}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### SMS Notifications

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "sms": {
      "numbers": ["+1234567890"],
      "onlyForSeverity": ["critical"],
      "message": "Alert: {{alert_name}} - Call: {{call_id}}"
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
SMS notifications should be reserved for critical alerts only to avoid alert fatigue.
</Warning>

## Alert Severity Levels

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Low">
    Minor issues that don't require immediate action. Review when convenient.

    **Examples**: Slightly low score, minor inconsistency
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium">
    Issues that should be addressed soon. Review within hours.

    **Examples**: Score below 70, customer mild frustration
  </Card>
  <Card title="High">
    Problems requiring prompt attention. Review within minutes.

    **Examples**: Major compliance miss, angry customer
  </Card>
  <Card title="Critical">
    Urgent issues needing immediate action. Review immediately.

    **Examples**: Data breach risk, complete system failure
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Managing Alert Noise

### Throttling

Prevent alert spam by setting cooldown periods:

```json
{
  "throttling": {
    "enabled": true,
    "cooldownMinutes": 15,
    "maxAlertsPerHour": 10
  }
}
```

This prevents the same alert from triggering more than once every 15 minutes.

### Grouping

Combine similar alerts into batches:

```json
{
  "grouping": {
    "enabled": true,
    "timeWindow": "5m",
    "maxGroupSize": 5,
    "notificationFormat": "{{count}} calls triggered '{{alert_name}}' in last 5 minutes"
  }
}
```

Instead of 5 separate notifications, you get one: "5 calls triggered 'Low Quality Score' in last 5 minutes."

### Scheduled Silence

Disable alerts during specific times:

```json
{
  "silenceSchedule": {
    "enabled": true,
    "windows": [
      {
        "days": ["saturday", "sunday"],
        "startTime": "00:00",
        "endTime": "23:59"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Viewing Triggered Alerts

    Navigate to **Alerts** to see:
    - List of recent alerts
    - Filter by severity or agent
    - Click alert to view associated call
    - Mark as resolved or dismiss
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Via API">
    ```bash
    # Get recent alerts
    curl https://api.chanl.ai/v1/alerts/triggered \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "timeRange": "24h",
        "severity": ["high", "critical"]
      }'
    ```

    Response:
    ```json

          "alertId": "alert_abc",
          "alertName": "Low Quality Score",
          "callId": "call_xyz",

          "resolved": false,
          "details": {
            "score": 68,
            "threshold": 70,
            "agent": "agent-v1"
          }
        }
      ],
      "total": 23
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Alert Analytics

Track alert patterns over time:

```javascript
const chanl = require('@chanl/sdk');

// Get alert frequency by type
const analytics = await chanl.alerts.analytics({
  timeRange: '30d',
  groupBy: 'alert_type'
});

console.log(analytics);
/*
{
  period: "30 days",
  totalAlerts: 147,
  byType: [
    {
      type: "quality_drop",
      count: 67,
      percentage: 45.6,
      trend: "decreasing"
    },
    {
      type: "compliance_issue",
      count: 42,
      percentage: 28.6,
      trend: "stable"
    },
    {
      type: "tool_failure",
      count: 38,
      percentage: 25.8,
      trend: "increasing"
    }
  ]
}
*/
```

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Critical Alerts">
    Begin with compliance and critical quality alerts. Add more as you understand patterns.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Appropriate Thresholds">
    Don't make thresholds too sensitive. Test and adjust based on actual alert volume.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Throttling">
    Always enable throttling to prevent alert fatigue from repeated similar issues.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Refine">
    Weekly review which alerts are useful vs noisy. Disable or adjust unhelpful ones.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document Response Procedures">
    Create runbooks for each critical alert type so team knows exactly what to do.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not receiving alerts">
    **Problem**: Alerts configured but no notifications arriving

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify alert is marked as "active"
    - Check notification channels are configured correctly
    - Test with webhook/email validator
    - Confirm calls are actually triggering conditions
    - Check spam folder for email notifications
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too many alerts">
    **Problem**: Being overwhelmed with alert notifications

    **Solutions**:
    - Enable throttling with appropriate cooldown
    - Increase severity thresholds
    - Use alert grouping to batch notifications
    - Review if conditions are too broad
    - Disable low-value alerts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Alerts triggering incorrectly">
    **Problem**: Getting alerts for false positives

    **Solutions**:
    - Review condition logic - may be too broad
    - Adjust thresholds based on actual data
    - Add additional conditions to narrow scope
    - Test alert with historical calls first
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slack notifications failing">
    **Problem**: Slack alerts not appearing

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify webhook URL is still valid
    - Check Slack app permissions
    - Confirm channel exists and bot has access
    - Test webhook with curl to isolate issue
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
