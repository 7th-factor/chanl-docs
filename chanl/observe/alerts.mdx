# Alerts

**Alerts** provide automated monitoring of conversations to track out-of-the-ordinary behaviors, compliance issues, and quality concerns. They help maintain high standards and ensure your AI agents perform consistently.

## Key Components

### Alert Configuration
- **Name** - Descriptive alert identifier
- **Trigger Condition** - Detailed prompt explaining what to monitor
- **Severity Level** - Urgency and importance of the alert

### Notification Settings
- **Notification Channels** - Where to send alerts
  - SMS notifications
  - Email alerts
  - Slack integration
  - Webhook endpoints
- **Frequency** - How often to send notifications
- **Escalation Rules** - When to escalate to higher levels

## Common Alert Types

### Compliance Monitoring
- Regulatory requirement violations
- Script adherence failures
- Required disclosure omissions
- Data handling concerns

### Quality Assurance
- Customer satisfaction indicators
- Response time thresholds
- Conversation flow issues
- Agent behavior concerns

### Performance Metrics
- Score threshold violations
- Success rate drops
- Error rate increases
- Timeout occurrences

### Security Concerns
- Sensitive data exposure
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Suspicious activity patterns
- System integrity issues

## Trigger Conditions

### Natural Language Detection
Use descriptive prompts to identify:
- Emotional escalation patterns
