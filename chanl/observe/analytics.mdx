# Analytics

**Analytics** is the main dashboard where users can check results from **Simulations**, monitor **Alerts**, see ongoing **Live Calls**, and review overall **Agent Performance** data.

## Dashboard Overview

The Analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your AI agent ecosystem, combining data from multiple sources to give you actionable insights.

## Key Metrics

### Simulation Analytics
- **Number of Runs** - Total simulation executions
- **Average Score** - Performance across all simulations
- **Trend Analysis** - Performance changes over time
- **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful interactions

### Alert Monitoring
- **Active Alerts** - Current notifications requiring attention
- **Alert Frequency** - How often alerts are triggered
- **Resolution Time** - Average time to address alerts
- **Alert Categories** - Types and distribution of alerts

### Call Analytics
- **Ongoing Calls** - Real-time active conversations
- **Call Volume** - Total number of calls processed
- **Average Duration** - Typical call length
- **Call Outcomes** - Success and failure rates

### Agent Performance
- **Individual Scores** - Performance by specific agent
- **Comparative Analysis** - Agent-to-agent comparison
- **Improvement Trends** - Performance changes over time
- **Optimization Opportunities** - Areas for enhancement

## Data Visualization

### Charts and Graphs
- Performance trends over time
- Score distribution across agents
- Alert frequency patterns
- Call volume by time period

### Real-time Displays
- Current system status
- Active alerts requiring attention
- Ongoing call monitoring
- Live performance metrics

## Filtering and Segmentation

### Time-based Filters
- Last 24 hours
- Last week
- Last month
- Custom date ranges

### Agent-based Filters
- Specific agent performance
- Agent group comparisons
- Provider-based analysis

### Scenario-based Filters
- Performance by scenario type
- Persona-specific results
- Scorecard category analysis

## Best Practices

- Review analytics daily for performance trends
- Set up custom dashboards for different stakeholders
- Use comparative analysis to identify top-performing agents
- Monitor alert patterns to prevent recurring issues
- Export data for deeper analysis and reporting
- Correlate performance data with agent configuration changes
