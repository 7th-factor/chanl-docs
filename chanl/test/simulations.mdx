# Simulations

Simulations are the results of your test scenarios—complete with recordings, transcripts, scores, and AI-powered insights. They show you exactly how your agent performed and what needs improvement.

## What Are Simulations?

When you run a scenario, Chanl creates simulations for every combination of persona and agent you've configured:

```
Scenario: "Refund Request"
Personas: [Frustrated, Analytical]
Agents: [Agent V1, Agent V2]

Results in 4 simulations:
1. Frustrated + Agent V1
2. Frustrated + Agent V2
3. Analytical + Agent V1
4. Analytical + Agent V2
```

Each simulation is a complete test conversation with scoring and analysis.

## Simulation Components

Every simulation includes:

## Simulation Naming Convention

Simulations are automatically named using this format:

```
{Scenario}_{Persona}_{Agent}_{Timestamp}

Examples:
- RefundRequest_Frustrated_AgentV1_2024-01-15-10-30
- PriceObjection_Skeptical_AgentV2_2024-01-15-14-22
```

This makes it easy to identify and compare simulations.

## AI-Powered Analysis

Every simulation includes automated insights:

### Example Analysis

```
🔍 Key Findings:

Strengths:
✅ Agent correctly identified customer frustration early
✅ Offered appropriate solution (refund)
✅ Maintained professional tone throughout

Issues:
⚠️ Took too long to offer solution (3 minutes)
⚠️ Didn't acknowledge customer's repeat call situation
❌ Failed to explain refund timeline clearly

Recommendations:
1. Update prompt to acknowledge repeat customers earlier
2. Add tool to check customer history automatically
3. Include refund timeline in standard response template

Similar Patterns:
📊 This agent scores 15% lower with "Frustrated" persona vs others
💡 Consider adding specific de-escalation training
```

## Comparing Simulations

Compare results across different dimensions:

### Agent Comparison

```bash
# Compare how two agents performed on same scenario
curl https://api.chanl.ai/v1/simulations/compare \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scenario": "refund-request",
    "agents": ["agent-v1", "agent-v2"]
  }'
```

Results show which agent performs better:
```
Agent V1 vs Agent V2 on "Refund Request"

Average Score:
Agent V1: 78

```

## Using Simulations for Training

Convert high-quality simulations into training data:

```javascript
const chanl = require('@chanl/sdk');

// Find top-performing simulations
const topSimulations = await chanl.simulations.list({
  minScore: 90,
  scenario: 'refund-request',
  limit: 10
});

// Export for fine-tuning
const trainingData = await chanl.fineTuning.prepareDataset({
  simulations: topSimulations.map(s => s.id),
  format: 'conversational',
  includeAnalysis: true
});

// Use in fine-tuning process
await chanl.fineTuning.create({
  baseModel: 'gpt-4',
  trainingData: trainingData,
  name: 'Refund Expert Model'
});
```

### Common Filters

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Score Range">
    ```bash
    # Find failing simulations
    curl "https://api.chanl.ai/v1/simulations?minScore=0&maxScore=70" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Tab>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Failed Simulations First">
    Start with lowest-scoring simulations to identify critical issues quickly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Look for Patterns">
    Don't just review individual simulations. Look for patterns across personas, scenarios, or time periods.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Listen to Audio">
    Reading transcripts is faster, but listening to audio catches tone and pacing issues transcripts miss.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare Versions">
    When you update an agent, run the same scenarios again and compare scores to validate improvements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use High Performers for Training">
    Export top-scoring simulations (90+) as examples for fine-tuning or prompt engineering.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simulation stuck in 'In Progress'">
    **Problem**: Simulation not completing

    **Solutions**:
    - Check if agent is responding (test manually)
    - Verify agent hasn't hit rate limits
    - Contact support if stuck >10 minutes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audio not playing">
    **Problem**: Can't listen to simulation audio

    **Solutions**:
    - Check browser allows audio playback
    - Try downloading file directly
    - Verify simulation completed successfully
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scores seem wrong">
    **Problem**: Scores don't match your expectations

    **Solutions**:
    - Review scorecard criteria - are they correctly weighted?
    - Check if recent scorecard changes affected scoring
    - Read AI analysis for scoring rationale
    - Test scorecard on known good/bad conversations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing simulations">
    **Problem**: Can't find expected simulations

    **Solutions**:
    - Check if scenario actually ran (review schedules)
    - Verify filters aren't hiding results
    - Look in Failed status - may have encountered errors
    - Check date range covers when simulation should have run
