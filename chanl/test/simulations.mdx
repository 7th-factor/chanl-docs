# Simulations

**Simulations** are the results of scenario runs, providing detailed insights into how your AI agents performed during testing interactions.

## Key Components

### Identification
- **Name** - Follows format: `Scenario_Persona_Agent_Timestamp`
- **Date** - When the simulation was executed
- **Status** - Current state of the simulation

### Content
- **Audio** - Complete recording of the interaction
- **Transcription** - Text version of the conversation
- **Analysis** - AI-powered evaluation and insights

### Evaluation
- **Score** - Numerical rating based on scorecard criteria
- **Status** - Execution state

## Status Types

### Completed
- Simulation finished successfully
- All data collected and processed
- Score and analysis available

### In-Progress
- Simulation currently running
- Real-time monitoring available
- Partial data may be accessible

### Scheduled
- Queued for future execution
- Part of automated schedule
- Waiting for resources or timing

## Analysis Components

### Performance Metrics
- Scorecard-based evaluation
- Criteria-specific scores
- Overall performance rating

### Conversation Analysis
- Turn-by-turn breakdown
- Key interaction points
- Success/failure identification

### Improvement Insights
- Areas for optimization
- Specific recommendations
- Comparative analysis with other simulations

## Using Simulation Data

### Quality Assessment
- Compare scores across agents and scenarios
- Identify performance patterns
- Track improvement over time

### Agent Optimization
- Analyze conversation flows
- Identify common failure points
- Extract successful interaction patterns

### Training Data Generation
- Use high-quality interactions for fine-tuning
- Create examples for prompt improvement
