# Schedules

Schedules are programmed runs of simulations that can be configured in Scenarios. They provide automated testing capabilities to ensure consistent evaluation of your AI agents.

## Key Components

### Schedule Information
- **Name** - Inherited from the associated Scenario
- **Periodicity** - How often the simulation runs
- **Last Run Date** - Timestamp of most recent execution
- **Next Run Date** - Calculated based on periodicity and last run
- **Amount of Runs** - Total number of executions completed
- **Active** - Whether the schedule is currently enabled

## Schedule Management

### Enabling/Disabling
Schedules can be temporarily disabled without deletion. When disabled:
- Scheduled simulations are skipped
- No new runs are triggered
- Schedule remains configured for easy re-activation

### Monitoring
Track schedule performance through:
- Run history and timestamps
- Success/failure rates
- Average execution times
- Resource usage patterns

## Automation Benefits

### Consistent Testing
- Regular evaluation of agent performance
- Automated regression testing
- Continuous quality monitoring

### Performance Tracking
- Trend analysis over time
- Impact assessment of agent changes
- Baseline performance establishment

### Resource Optimization
- Distribute testing load across time periods
- Avoid peak usage conflicts
- Efficient resource utilization

## Best Practices

- Set appropriate frequencies based on agent update cycles
- Monitor schedule performance and adjust as needed
- Use descriptive naming for easy identification
- Disable schedules during maintenance windows
- Review and clean up unused schedules regularly
- Coordinate schedules to avoid resource conflicts
