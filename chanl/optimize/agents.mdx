# Agents

**Agents** are the core focus of the platform - AI-powered conversation systems that you aim to improve through testing, monitoring, and optimization. Agents are fetched from their respective providers and can be configured and enhanced through the platform.

## Key Components

### Basic Information
- **Name** - Agent identifier and display name
- **Description** - Purpose and capabilities overview
- **Provider** - Source platform (VAPI, Bland, etc.)

### Configuration
- **Prompt** - Core behavioral instructions
- **Tools** - Available actions and capabilities
- **Model Settings** - AI model configuration

## Model Configuration

### Provider Settings
- **Provider** - AI service provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Model** - Specific model version (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **Temperature** - Creativity/consistency balance (0.0-1.0)
- **Tokens** - Maximum response length

### Performance Tuning
- **Response Speed** - Optimization for quick responses
- **Quality Settings** - Balance between speed and quality
- **Context Management** - Conversation memory handling

## Prompt Management

### Core Instructions
- Behavioral guidelines and personality
- Communication style and tone
- Knowledge base and expertise areas
- Conversation flow management

### Specialized Prompts
- Scenario-specific instructions
- Customer type adaptations
- Error handling procedures
- Escalation protocols

### Prompt Optimization
- A/B testing different prompt versions
- Performance-based improvements
- Library integration for proven prompts

## Tool Integration

### Available Tool Types
- **API Requests** - External service integrations
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - Advanced context management
- **Routing** - Call transfer and escalation
- **Data Lookup** - Information retrieval systems

### Tool Configuration
- Authentication and security settings
- Response formatting and parsing
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Performance monitoring

## Provider Integration

### Supported Platforms
- **VAPI** - Voice AI platform integration
- **Bland** - Conversational AI service
- **Custom APIs** - Direct integrations

### Synchronization
- Automatic agent discovery
- Configuration sync
- Performance data collection
- Real-time updates

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Conversation success rates
- Average response times
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Error and escalation rates

### Optimization Insights
- Common failure patterns
- Improvement opportunities
- Configuration impact analysis
- Comparative performance data

## Agent Lifecycle

### Development
1. Initial configuration and prompt setup
2. Tool integration and testing
3. Scenario-based validation

### Testing
1. Simulation runs with various personas
2. Performance evaluation against scorecards
3. Iterative improvements based on results

### Production
1. Live call monitoring
2. Continuous performance tracking
3. Ongoing optimization based on real data

### Optimization
1. Prompt refinement based on insights
2. Tool configuration improvements
3. Model parameter adjustments

## Best Practices

- Start with clear, specific prompts and refine iteratively
- Test agents thoroughly with diverse personas before production
- Monitor performance continuously and adjust based on data
- Use version control for prompt and configuration changes
- Document successful configurations for replication
- Regular review and updates based on business needs
- Maintain security best practices for API integrations
